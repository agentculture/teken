# Agent-first CLI reference — integration guide

You (the agent) are reading this because someone ran `afi cli cite` against
their project. This folder contains the Python agent-first CLI pattern as a
reference — `{{tokens}}` are **not substituted**. Your job is to apply the
pattern to the host project on its own terms.

## Tokens

Substitute these throughout every file you integrate:

| Token             | Meaning                                    | Example        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| `{{project_name}}` | The published package / CLI name.          | `acme-tool`    |
| `{{slug}}`         | snake_case package slug (dashes→underscores). | `acme_tool`  |
| `{{module}}`       | Importable top-level module (same as slug).   | `acme_tool`  |

## File roles

### stable-contract — copy verbatim, then token-substitute

These files express the contract the rubric checks. Reshape them only if
your project already has equivalents; otherwise copy byte-for-byte.

- `{{slug}}/cli/_errors.py` — `AfiError`, exit-code policy.
- `{{slug}}/cli/_output.py` — stdout/stderr split + `--json` helpers.
- `{{slug}}/cli/_commands/explain.py` — the `explain` command.
- `{{slug}}/explain/__init__.py` + `{{slug}}/explain/catalog.py` — catalog resolver.

### shape-adapt — model the structure; rewrite to fit the host project

These show the target shape but will almost certainly be reshaped to match
the host project's existing module layout, prog name, and commands.

- `{{slug}}/cli/__init__.py` — the parser + `_dispatch`. Reuse the
  `_ArgumentParser` override and the try/except pattern verbatim; add your
  own noun groups in the marked location.
- `{{slug}}/cli/_commands/learn.py` — keep the structure (TEXT body + JSON
  payload) but rewrite the content to describe the host tool.
- `{{slug}}/explain/catalog.py` — rewrite entries for the host tool's
  commands; keep the `()` / `("{{project_name}}",)` alias pattern.
- `{{slug}}/__init__.py`, `{{slug}}/__main__.py` — usually already exist in
  the host project; update only if missing.
- `tests/test_cli.py` — merge into the host's test suite; adjust imports
  and the `{{project_name}}` literal expectations.

## Integration workflow (recommended)

1. Read `MANIFEST.json` for a machine-readable file inventory.
2. Copy the **stable-contract** files into the host project at the
   equivalent paths under the host's package. Substitute tokens.
3. Port the **shape-adapt** files: read them, take the structure, rewrite
   content to match the host's naming and command surface.
4. Wire the parser: import `learn` and `explain` modules and call their
   `register(sub)` functions in the host's argparse setup.
5. Ensure the host's top-level parser installs the `_ArgumentParser`
   override so unknown-verb errors emit with a `hint:` line.
6. Run `afi cli verify .` from the host project to confirm the five rubric
   bundles pass.

## Rubric bundles checked by `afi cli verify`

1. **Structure** — `pyproject.toml` with `[project.scripts]`, `tests/` dir,
   `<tool> --help` exits 0.
2. **Learnability** — `<tool> learn` exits 0, stdout ≥ 200 chars,
   mentions purpose, commands, exit codes, `--json`, `explain`.
3. **JSON** — `<tool> learn --json` is parseable; stderr clean on success;
   `<tool> explain --json` works.
4. **Errors** — bogus verb exits non-zero with a `hint:` line and no
   Python traceback.
5. **Explain** — `explain`, `explain <tool>`, and bogus-path-failure with
   hint all work.

## After integration

Delete this reference (`rm -rf .afi/reference/`) or re-run `afi cli cite` to
refresh it. The `.afi/` entry in `.gitignore` keeps it out of commits.
