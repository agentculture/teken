"""``afi doctor`` engine — self-diagnosis for an installed afi.

The doctor verb is the agent-first contract for "tell me what's wrong and
how to fix it." For afi itself it surfaces inconsistencies between the
package, its declared version, the CLI parser tree, the explain catalog,
and the bundled reference tree. It is read-only and fast (no subprocesses,
no network); deeper black-box auditing of *target* CLIs is what
``afi cli doctor <path>`` provides via the rubric runner.

Public surface:

- :func:`run_self_diagnosis` — collect every self-check and return a
  :class:`Diagnosis` carrying the flat list of :class:`CheckResult` plus a
  precomputed ``healthy`` flag.
- :class:`Diagnosis` — aggregate (subject, healthy, checks) used by the
  CLI's text/JSON renderers.
- :func:`is_healthy` — returns True when no ``error``-severity check
  failed; mirrors the ``afi cli doctor`` non-strict exit-code policy.
