"""Markdown catalog for ``afi explain <path>``.

Each entry is verbatim markdown. Keys are command-path tuples. The empty
tuple and ``("afi",)`` both resolve to the root entry (aliased).

Keep bodies self-contained — an agent reading a single entry should get
enough context without chaining reads.

# afi

afi is the AgentCulture Agent First Interface scaffolder. It emits reference
drops for agent-first CLIs (and, later, MCP servers and HTTP sites) and
audits any tool against the six-bundle agent-first rubric.

## Verbs

- `afi learn` — structured self-teaching prompt.
- `afi explain <path>` — markdown docs for any noun/verb.
- `afi overview [path]` — descriptive rollup across all interface surfaces.
- `afi cli cite [path]` — drop the CLI reference pattern into a project.
- `afi cli verify [path]` — audit a CLI against the rubric.
- `afi cli overview [path]` — read-only snapshot of a target CLI.

## Universal verb triple (agent-first)

Every agent-first CLI exposes `learn` / `explain` / `overview`:

- `learn` — what is this tool?
- `explain <path>` — what does this command do?
- `overview [path]` — what is *present* in the subject the command addresses?

## Principles

afi is deliberately dumb: it emits references with literal `{{tokens}}` and
never merges into a consumer project. The agent running afi handles
integration. Pre-commit, CI, and other agent-workflow tooling live in the
sibling project `agex-cli`.

## Exit-code policy

- `0` success
- `1` user-input error (bad flag, bad path, missing arg)
- `2` environment / setup error (tool not installed, unreadable file)
- `3+` reserved

## See also

- `afi explain learn`
- `afi explain explain`
- `afi explain overview`

- `afi explain cli verify`

"""

_LEARN = """\
# afi learn

Prints a structured self-teaching prompt covering afi's purpose, command
map, exit-code policy, `--json` support, and `explain` pointer.

## Usage

    afi learn
    afi learn --json

In JSON mode, emits
`{"tool", "purpose", "commands", "exit_codes", "json_support", "explain_pointer"}`
to stdout.

## Rubric role

`learn` is bundle 2 (learnability) of the agent-first rubric. Any CLI that
passes bundle 2 prints ≥200 characters and mentions purpose, commands, exit
codes, `--json`, and `explain`.
"""

_EXPLAIN = """\
# afi explain <path>

Prints markdown documentation for any noun/verb path. Unlike `--help`
(terse, positional), `explain` is global and addressable by path.

## Usage

    afi explain afi
    afi explain learn
    afi explain cli
    afi explain cli cite
    afi explain cli verify --json

In text mode emits the markdown to stdout. In JSON mode emits
`{"path": [...], "markdown": "..."}` to stdout.

## Path resolution

Paths are shell-tokenised: `afi explain cli cite` resolves to the catalog
entry `("cli", "cite")`. Unknown paths exit `1` with a `hint:` pointing at
`afi explain afi` for the top-level map.

## Rubric role

`explain` is bundle 5 of the agent-first rubric: every registered noun must
resolve, and bad paths must exit non-zero with remediation.
"""

_CLI = """\
# afi cli

The `cli` noun groups verbs that act on *a CLI project* (the target
project). From v0.3 there are three verbs:

- `afi cli cite [path]` — drop the Python agent-first reference tree into
  `<path>/.afi/reference/python-cli/` for an agent to integrate.
- `afi cli verify [path]` — run the six-bundle agent-first rubric against
  the CLI at `<path>`.
- `afi cli overview [path]` — read-only descriptive snapshot of the CLI at
  `<path>` (or afi's own scaffolded template when no path is given).

See `afi explain cli cite`, `afi explain cli verify`, and
`afi explain cli overview` for details.
"""

_CLI_CITE = """\
# afi cli cite [path] [--lang LANG] [--out DIR] [--json]

Emit the agent-first CLI reference tree into the target project.

## What it does

1. Copies the reference tree (bundled with afi-cli under
   `afi/cite/references/<lang>-cli/`) to `<path>/.afi/reference/<lang>-cli/`
   wholesale. Tokens `{{project_name}}`, `{{slug}}`, `{{module}}` are left
   **literal** — the agent consuming the reference substitutes them.
2. Adds `.afi/` to `<path>/.gitignore` if missing. Never modifies
   `.gitignore` otherwise.
3. Never touches anything outside `<path>/.afi/` and the single gitignore
   line.

Re-running wipes and re-writes `<path>/.afi/reference/<lang>-cli/` —
always the latest reference. The `.gitignore` line is check-before-modify.

## Arguments

- `path` (optional, default `.`) — target project directory.
- `--lang` — reference language. v0.2 supports `python`.
- `--out DIR` — override the output directory (default:
  `<path>/.afi/reference/<lang>-cli/`).
- `--json` — emit the report as a JSON object instead of text.

## Output contains

- Count of files written and their root directory.
- Whether `.gitignore` was updated.
- A three-step `next_steps` list: read AGENT.md, apply the pattern,
  run `afi cli verify .`.
- Pointers to `afi explain cli cite` and `afi explain cli verify` for
  more detail.

## Exit codes

- `0` success
- `1` user error (bad lang, missing target, bad `--out`)
- `2` environment error (reference tree missing in install)
"""

_CLI_VERIFY = """\
# afi cli verify [path] [--json] [--strict]

Audit a CLI at `path` against the five-bundle agent-first rubric.

## Bundles

1. **structure** — `pyproject.toml` with `[project.scripts]`, `tests/`
   dir, `<tool> --help` exits 0.
2. **learnability** — `<tool> learn` exits 0, stdout ≥ 200 chars, mentions
   purpose, commands, exit codes, `--json`, `explain`.
3. **json** — `<tool> learn --json` is parseable; stderr clean on success;
   `<tool> explain --json` works.
4. **errors** — bogus verb exits non-zero with a `hint:` line, no Python
   traceback; exit-code policy documented in `learn`.
5. **explain** — `<tool> explain` and `<tool> explain <tool>` succeed;
   bogus path fails with remediation.

## Strategy

Hybrid: static file checks (pyproject, tests/) + black-box subprocess
probes for every behavioral check. `<tool>` is resolved from
`[project.scripts]`; if not on PATH, falls back to `uv run --project
<path>`.

## Arguments

- `path` (optional, default `.`) — target project directory.
- `--json` — emit the full report as JSON (`results` + `summary`).
- `--strict` — treat warnings as failures.

## Exit codes

- `0` if no `error`-severity check failed (strict: no failure at all).
- `1` if the rubric failed.
- `2` if verify itself couldn't set up (can't find the tool, no
  pyproject, etc.).
"""


_OVERVIEW = """\
# afi overview [path]

Emits a **read-only descriptive snapshot** of the interface surfaces
present in the target project. Descriptive, not diagnostic — see
`afi cli verify` for rubric grading.

## Universal verb triple

`overview` is the third verb of the agent-first universal triple
(`learn`, `explain`, `overview`). Other culture-embedded CLIs follow the
same pattern:

- `agex overview --agent <backend>` — agex config for a backend.
- `culture mesh overview` / `culture agent overview` — subject-of-noun.
- `afi cli overview [path]` / `afi overview [path]` — afi's two entry
  points.

## What it reports

- **afi overview [path]** — rollup across all afi surfaces. In v0.3 only
  the `cli` surface is implemented; `mcp` (v0.4) and `site` (v0.5) follow.
  Currently delegates to the `cli` inspector and appends a `> note:`
  about unimplemented surfaces.
- **afi cli overview [path]** — deep on the CLI subject: project root,
  command surface (detected nouns/verbs), agent-first triple presence,
  rubric posture, notes for agents.

## Zero-target default

If `path` is omitted, or the target has no detectable CLI surface, afi
describes **its own scaffolded reference template** (the tree under
`afi/cite/references/python-cli/`). afi knows its own creations
perfectly, so this fallback is complete and deterministic.

## Usage

    afi overview
    afi overview .
    afi cli overview .
    afi cli overview /path/to/project
    afi cli overview --json .

## JSON shape

    {
      "subject": str,
      "path": str | null,
      "sections": [{"heading": str, "body_md": str, "findings": [...]}],
      "warnings": [str, ...],
      "notes": [str, ...]
    }

Stable keys — culture's embed helper can machine-read the output.

## Rubric role

Rubric bundle 6 (`overview_cmd`) asserts that every agent-first CLI
exposes:

- a top-level `overview` verb that works and accepts `--json`;
- an `overview` verb under every noun that has action-verbs;
- a stable JSON shape (`subject`, `sections` required);
- **read-only** behaviour (the target tree's file mtimes must not change).
