# Skill provenance ledger

This repo vendors a handful of skills from sibling AgentCulture
projects under `.claude/skills/`. This ledger tracks the upstream
source for each vendored skill so future re-syncs (and the auto-broadcast
issues like #17 / #18 that triggered the initial vendoring) know where
to pull from and what was adapted locally.

The AgentCulture skills-portability rule: each skill is self-contained,
nothing reaches across skill boundaries at runtime, and a vendoring repo
adapts identifier-only details (consumer name, signature literal) without
forking the script logic.

| Skill | Upstream | Local path | Vendored since | Local divergence |
|-------|----------|------------|----------------|------------------|
| `cicd` (overlap verbs: `lint`, `open`, `read`, `reply`, `delta`) | [`agentculture/agex-cli`](https://github.com/agentculture/agex-cli) — `agex pr <verb>` is the upstream as of steward 0.12.0; `workflow.sh` is a thin delegate | `.claude/skills/cicd/scripts/workflow.sh` (entry points) | afi-cli 0.7.0 (issue [#17](https://github.com/agentculture/afi-cli/issues/17)) | No script logic changed. `workflow.sh` calls `agex pr` directly. |
| `cicd` (steward extensions: `status`, `await`) | [`agentculture/steward`](https://github.com/agentculture/steward/tree/main/.claude/skills/cicd) (local: `../steward/.claude/skills/cicd/`) — to migrate into `agex pr` per [agex-cli#41](https://github.com/agentculture/agex-cli/issues/41) when that lands | `.claude/skills/cicd/scripts/pr-status.sh`, `pr-reply.sh`, `portability-lint.sh`, `_resolve-nick.sh`; `workflow.sh status`/`await` subcommands | afi-cli 0.7.0 (issue [#17](https://github.com/agentculture/afi-cli/issues/17)) | Identifier-only adapted: SKILL.md prose reframed as the afi-cli edition; environment-variable names (`STEWARD_PR_AWAIT_*`, `STEWARD_AGEX_AGENT`) kept verbatim for interface stability. Four known upstream bugs filed at [steward#33](https://github.com/agentculture/steward/issues/33) — picked up on next resync; not patched locally to keep this PR vendor-pristine. |
| `communicate` | [`agentculture/steward`](https://github.com/agentculture/steward/tree/main/.claude/skills/communicate) (local: `../steward/.claude/skills/communicate/`) | `.claude/skills/communicate/` | afi-cli 0.7.0 (issue [#18](https://github.com/agentculture/afi-cli/issues/18)) | Identifier-only adapted: SKILL.md prose reframed as a downstream consumer; broadcast section reduced (afi-cli does not broadcast); example issue titles rewritten. agtag resolves signature `<nick>` from `culture.yaml`. |
| `lint-markdown` | Local-only | `.claude/skills/lint-markdown/` | n/a | Repo-local skill (not vendored). |
| `version-bump` | Local-only | `.claude/skills/version-bump/` | n/a | Repo-local skill (not vendored). |

## Re-sync recipe

When the upstream steward releases a new version of a vendored skill
(broadcast lands as a new GitHub issue on this repo), follow the
recipe in that issue body. The short form:

```bash
git checkout -b skill/<name>-resync
git rm -r .claude/skills/<name>
cp -R ../steward/.claude/skills/<name> .claude/skills/
chmod +x .claude/skills/<name>/scripts/*.sh
# Re-apply the local adaptations listed above for the skill.
# Update this ledger row's "Vendored since" cell.
# Bump version + CHANGELOG. Open PR.
```

## Why a ledger

The `steward announce-skill-update` verb parses this file's "Downstream
copies" cell when broadcasting. afi-cli is not listed as a ledger consumer
upstream (the issues that initially vendored these skills were one-off
`--to agentculture/afi-cli` broadcasts), but keeping a local ledger makes
re-syncs predictable and the divergence column explicit.
